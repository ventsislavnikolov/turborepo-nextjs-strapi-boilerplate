# Requirements

1. NodeJS => v14 (https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Docker (https://www.docker.com/)

# Turborepo install

If you wanna use the Docker, don't install the dependencies localy because there is a bug about
Pnpm. So you have use the normal build with

1. npm install -g pnpm
2. npm install -g commitizen
3. npx playwright install
4. pnpm install
5. rename the correct .ENV file
6. pnpm dev

or with Docker

1. make sure that you dont have any node_modules folder localy
2. rename the correct .ENV file
3. rename the correct .ENV file in apps/cms/
4. docker-compose up -d

# Turborepo starter

This is an official starter Turborepo.

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `cms`: [Strapi.io](https://strapi.io/) headless CMS for back-end app.
- `web`: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for
  front-end app.
- `ui`: a stub React component library with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and
  [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) shared by `web` application.
- `eslint-config-react`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and
  `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tailwind-config`: `tailwind.config.js`s used throughout the monorepo
- `tsconfig`: [Typescript] (https://www.typescriptlang.org/) `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the
  monorepo for Typescrip syntax
- `web-tests`: [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) tests for `web` application.

### Building packages/ui

This example is setup to build `packages/ui` and output the transpiled source and compiled styles to
`dist/`. This was chosen to make sharing one `tailwind.config.js` as easy as possible, and to ensure
only the CSS that is used by the current application and its dependencies is generated.

Another option is to consume `packages/ui` directly from source without building. If using this
option, you will need to update your `tailwind.config.js` to be aware of your package locations, so
it can find all usages of the `tailwindcss` class names.

For example, in [tailwind.config.js](packages/tailwind-config/tailwind.config.js):

```js
  content: [
    `src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}`,
    "../../packages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
```
